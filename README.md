# Dan & Erin Engagement

I took her on a hike and stopped to take some panos. This hike was the fist one we went on togehter when we started dating. When I asked her to take a quick pano, I pulled out a ring and proposed as she took it. I captured her reaction. View the pano on my <a href="http://dan-blair.ca/projects/engagement/">portfolio site</a>.
